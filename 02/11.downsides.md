# Downsides

🙈 Introducing a new way to write components means more to learn and means confusion while both classes and functions are used.


🙈 The “Rules of Hooks”: in order to make Hooks work, React requires that Hooks are called unconditionally. Component authors may find it unintuitive that Hook calls can't be moved inside if statements, loops, and helper functions.


🙈 The “Rules of Hooks” can make some types of refactoring more difficult. For example, adding an early return to a component is no longer possible without moving all Hook calls to before that conditional.


🙈 Event handlers need to be recreated on each render in order to reference the latest copy of props and state, which reduces the effectiveness of PureComponent and React.memo.


🙈 It's possible for closures (like the ones passed to useEffect and useCallback) to capture old versions of props and state values. In particular, this happens if the “inputs” array is inadvertently missing one of captured variables. This can be confusing.


🙈 React relies on internal global state in order to determine which component is currently rendering when each Hook is called. This is “less pure” and may be unintuitive.


🙈 React.memo (as a replacement for shouldComponentUpdate) only has access to the old and new props; there's no easy way to skip rerendering for an inconsequential state update.


🙈 useState uses a tuple return value that requires typing the same name twice to declare a state field (like const [rhinoceros, setRhinoceros] = useState(null);), which may be cumbersome for long names.


🙈 useState uses the overloaded type () => T | T to support lazy initialization. But when storing a function in state (that is, when T is a function type) you must always use a lazy initializer useState(() => myFunction) because the types are indistinguishable at runtime. Similarly, the functional updater form must be used when setting state to a new function value.

# React is clean by design

- segregate responsibilities by components, not technologies
- you divide reponsibilities based on what you see on the screen
- one way data flow
- explicit dependencies - props
- explicit interface - prop types
- explicit state updates
- explicit event handlers
- no inheritance, (functional) composition instead (https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)



## Component = primary unit of code reuse



## HoC, Render Prop, Hook = secondary unit of code reuse

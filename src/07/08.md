# ~~SOLID~~ components

Separate code that supports different actors
Look for cohesion, avoid coupling



Make your components/hooks/functions/modules easy to extend...
...but do it only when you need it ("fool me once...")



Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. (Zen of Python)
Don't surprise people



Segregate functionalities
Decompose functions



Wrap libraries (create abstractions)
Inject stuff and not only dependencies

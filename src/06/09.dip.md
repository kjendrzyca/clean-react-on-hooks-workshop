# ðŸ’¡ Dependecy Inversion Principle (DIP)



## Stable software architectures are those that avoid depending on volatile concretions, and that favor the use of stable abstract interfaces

> ~Clean Architecture


It is the volatile concrete elements of our system that we want to avoid depending on. Those are the modules that we are actively developing, and that are undergoing frequent change



ðŸ’¡ Interfaces are less volatile than implementations.



## Never mention the name of anything concrete and volatile



## Do not depend on concrete modules.



## Rules:

1. Wrap libraries (create abstractions)
2. Inject stuff and not only dependencies

# ðŸ’¡ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)



## A module should have one, and only one, reason to change

What does "reason to change" mean?



## A module should be responsible to one, and only one, user or stakeholder

Better.



## A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor

Best.

But who is this "actor"?



Another name is **"axis or vector of change"**.



"Changes occur around the axis and that suggest that each responsibility acts as a central point for the class's existence.
You want a class to have a single reason to exist such that changes are easier to manage."

"SRP is just a marketing term, that tried to promote the much older (and much better defined) cohesion and coupling concepts. I would suggest to just go back to those terms whenever there is a question about SRP."



## Symptoms:

- merge conflicts (too much stuff in one place, changing at the same time for different reasons)
- everyone works in the same place



## Rules:

1. Separate code that supports different actors
2. Look for cohesion, avoid coupling

# ðŸ’¡ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)



## "If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program"



## A simple violation of substitutability can cause a system's architecture to be polluted with a significant amount of extra mechanisms



## Smell: Explicit checking for type

- is a?
- kind of?
- case
- typeof?
- instanceof?



## Rules:

1. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. (Zen of Python)
2. Although practicality beats purity. (also Zen of Python)
3. **Don't surprise people** ðŸ˜®

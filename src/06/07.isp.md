# ðŸ’¡ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)



## The lesson here is that depending on something that carries baggage that you don't need can cause you troubles you didn't expect.



ðŸ‘‰ **Avoid depending on things that you don't use.**



## Dynamically typed languages are more flexible by design



## Examples

- overloaded module/package
- overloaded component that does too much
- bloated hook



## Rules:

1. Segregate functionalities
2. Decompose functions

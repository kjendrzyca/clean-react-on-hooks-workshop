# ðŸ’¡ AHA (aka WET, aka The Tule of Three)

## Removing code duplication is important, but it tends to add a cognitive overhead

```js
if (subject == null) {
  throw new ArgumentNullException("subject");
}
```



```js
Guard.AgainstNull(subject, "subject");
```



## Optimize for change first

"We should be mindful of the fact that we don't really know what requirements will be placed upon our code in the future" ~Kent C. Dodds



## Rule of three

1. Write a piece of code.
2. Write the same piece of code again. Resist the urge to generalize.
3. Write the same piece of code again. Now you are allowed to consider generalizing it.



## WET - Write Everything Twice

"You can ask yourself "Haven't I written this before?" two times, but never three." ~Conlin Durbin



## AHA - Avoid Hasty Abstractions

The more samples you have of duplicated code, the better you understand what is truly duplicated, and what varies.



## Rules:

1. Avoid hasty abstractions
2. Optimize for change first

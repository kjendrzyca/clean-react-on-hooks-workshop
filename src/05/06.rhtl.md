## 1. Testing implementation details is bad (again)



## 2. "Invariant Violation: Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component."



## 3. Using this library, you do not have to concern yourself with how to construct, render or interact with the react component in order to test your hook.



## 4. That's why RHTL is fun



## 5. üêè Test your hooks this way if they ARE reusable

From the docs:

### When to use this library

- You're writing a library with one or more custom hooks that are not directly tied a component
- You have a complex hook that is difficult to test through component interactions

### When not to use this library
- Your hook is defined along side a component and is only used there
- Your hook is easy to test by just testing the components using it

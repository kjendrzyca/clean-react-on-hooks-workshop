# Rules of Hooks



## Only Call Hooks at the Top Level

**Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.**

✅ Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function.

By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.
That’s what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.



## Only Call Hooks from React Functions

**Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.** Instead, you can:

✅ Call Hooks from React function components.

✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks.

By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.
React relies on the order in which Hooks are called

# Why?

## ðŸ‘‰ Hooks let you reuse logic between components without changing your component hierarchy.

1. Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions
based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data),

2. "You can npm install an even greater percentage of your application code than before"

3. Reusing project-local code was never as easy.
